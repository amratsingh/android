Steps:

1. Create a directory with name “REA”

2. Keep all the tools (Dex2jar, apktool, jd-gui) into this directory

3. Extract dex2jar and jd-gui zip files into the same directory.

4. Now get an apk of particular application, to get that you will require ES file manager or any application which allows to export apk. For the demo purpose, I have downloaded Android wear application.

5. Execute the below command to convert the apk file into jar. Once it gets converted successfully, it will create a jar file with the name “appname-dex2jar” for the “appname.apk”.

   D:\RE-Android\dex2jar-0.0.9.15>d2j-dex2jar.bat "d:\REA\appname.apk"

6. Now start jd-gui application and open the “Android Wear_1.0.5.1630507-dex2jar” file and enjoy reading other application’s classes and code.

7. Execute apktool d yourapk.apk command to decode resources. Executing this command will give you below project structure.
